Why would a private gun control lobbying organization, supported by wealthy donors, need state/public money? 2) Are you aware that the WA Dept of Commerce's Office of Homeless Youth ""Protected Healthcare Work Group"" is paying teenagers $57 an hour if they ""self identify"" as ""trans+"" and go on a Zoom meeting? 3) Seriously, can we recall Reykdal as State School Superintendent? He's clearly trying to provoke a fight with the White House. 4) A local mayor [in Clark County] is passing out ""red cards"" telling illegal immigrants how to trick ICE agents. I'm worried ICE agents might get hurt if they come to this area. Is there any way you can let ICE know? 5) I'm concerned about the whole Transportation Budget and how unfair it is to rural citizens. No exemptions for agricultural off-road travel, transponders to track movement, etc. How can these money grubbers be stopped? 6) Please help passing any of the bills that repeal HB 1227/""Families Together Act.""

Facebook,Gun Control,Recommended,,,Calida Troxell,2/22/25,"I agree with Mr Smith. I still think Larimer County should have elected Jeff Fisher. This is going to get interesting.At a retired sheriff who spent 30 plus years defending his community, I have to say, this latest gun control bill going through the Colorado state legislature is the worst I’ve seen-Full stop. Having read through the bill thoroughly, I can attest it will create an utter minefield for law abiding Coloradans. It’s another example of the progressive left legislature spiking the ball, because they can. This bill was framed as a way to “fix”  the ineffective and defective magazine ban passed by the legislature in 2012. This bill will only be worse as it will punish current residents by restricting them from purchasing firearms that future residents will be able to bring into the state without restriction. What sense does that make? The latest iteration of the bill requires the completion of a training program on handling a semiautomatic firearm in order to purchase certain semiautomatic firearms. To be clear, no mass murder occurred because the killer lacked firearms training.  Further, this bill attempts to establish sheriffs as the gatekeeper to your ability to simply exercise your right to possess many commonly used firearms for the defense of you and your family by requiring you to seek a firearms possession license through the sheriff to purchase certain firearms in the future. I predict if this goes through and is signed into law, there may very likely be a sizeable number of Colorado sheriffs who simply refuse to play along with a regulatory scheme they sincerely believe is an affront to the constitution they took an oath to uphold. If sheriffs are forced to choose between upholding the constitution they swore an oath to protect or blindly enforcing an arguably unconstiutional  regulatory scheme passed by the legislature, the choice will be clear.  That my friends will set up a massive showdown between Colorado’s governor and attorney general and many of the 62 county sheriffs across the state. Keep in mind, only the citizens of the county can choose their sheriffs and only the citizens of the county can remove their sheriffs. My question is this - Is the governor prepared to sign a bill that will likely create a constitutional showdown that would draw national attention to his state or will he stand up to the gun control lobby in his party and say enough is enough? I truly hope it’s the second option. As a post script- Reading through the bill thoroughly, it occurred to me that the bill restricts Colorado residents who are American citizens from possessing firearms that it will allow to be possessed by certain non-US citizens and those sponsoring this bill most likely have no idea what I’m speaking of because they don’t understand their own law.

Facebook,Universal Health Care,Recommended,,,National Improved Medicare for All,12/30/24,"From Ira Dember:  Carter's corrupt successor, Ronald Reagan -- a forgettable Hollywood actor -- had earlier colluded with the AMA in ""Operation Coffee Cup"" to help kill universal healthcare. Later, to defeat Carter and become president, Reagan committed treason.  [ Hartmann, Aug 2023: ] During the Carter/Reagan election battle of 1980, then-President Carter had reached a deal with newly-elected Iranian President Abdolhassan Bani-Sadr to release the fifty-two hostages held by students at the American Embassy in Tehran.Bani-Sadr was a moderate and, as he explained in an editorial for The Christian Science Monitor, successfully ran for President that summer on the popular position of releasing the hostages: “I openly opposed the hostage-taking throughout the election campaign…. I won the election with over 76 percent of the vote…. Other candidates also were openly against hostage-taking, and overall, 96 percent of votes in that election were given to candidates who were against it [hostage-taking].” Carter was confident that with Bani-Sadr’s help, he could end the embarrassing hostage crisis that had been a thorn in his political side ever since it began in November of 1979. But behind Carter’s back, the Reagan campaign worked out a deal with the leader of Iran’s radical faction — Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini — to keep the hostages in captivity until after the 1980 Presidential election. Khomeini needed spare parts for American weapons systems the Shah had purchased for Iran, and Reagan was happy to promise them (...) The Reagan campaign’s secret negotiations with Khomeini — the so-called “October Surprise” — sabotaged President Carter’s and Iranian President Bani-Sadr’s attempts to free the hostages. As President Bani-Sadr told The Christian Science Monitor in March of 2013: “After arriving in France [in 1981], I told a BBC reporter that I had left Iran to expose the symbiotic relationship between Khomeinism and Reaganism. “Ayatollah Khomeini and Ronald Reagan had organized a clandestine negotiation, later known as the ‘October Surprise,’ which prevented the attempts by myself and then-US President Jimmy Carter to free the hostages before the 1980 US presidential election took place. The fact that they were not released tipped the results of the election in favor of Reagan.” And Reagan’s treason — just like Nixon’s treason — worked perfectly. The Iran hostage crisis continued and torpedoed Jimmy Carter’s re-election hopes. And the same day Reagan took the oath of office — to the minute, as Reagan put his hand on the bible, by way of Iran’s acknowledging the deal — the American hostages in Iran were released. Keeping his side of the deal, Reagan began selling the Iranians weapons and spare parts in 1981, and continued until he was busted for it in 1986, producing the so-called “Iran Contra” scandal. But, like Nixon, Reagan was never held to account for the criminal and treasonous actions that brought him to office.",In-favor,12,7,0,4,0,1,0,0,1,8

A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal last year showed that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles. In the Medicare Advantage system, insurers get lump-sum payments from the federal government to oversee enrollees’ Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases.

We over all agree if someone works full time they should have health insurance. Healthcare is a must. Small businesses often have a very hard time affording health insurance for their employees so instead they hire part timers. This means less quality production- the more you do something the better you are at it. As a result, most workers find themselves requiring multiple jobs to pay their bills equaling a 58 hour work week (2- 29 hour per week jobs) which also creates exhaustion- leading to higher incidents of accidents in the work place, leading to higher business insurance.  Small businesses also lose highly skilled workers to larger businesses because they cannot equal the benefits of the larger employers. I won't get into the strength of collective bargains when you have a large universal front- provided by universal health insurance, but you get the picture.

The key recipient now, and just a guess, future state is and will be Foster Care (sometimes after babies being dropped at local CPS locations). The Foster Care system today is overloaded to say the very least, and that is a whole different social and moral conversation. Foster Parents are most often, but not always (understanding that a percentage do it for the money and benefits…sadly) dependent on Medicaid for the medical care (and other services to subsidize for healthy foods). So far everything I’m stating is fact based on personal family experience. Often times this is how we get people to buying into fostering (many, many, many other reasons) and hopefully giving children forever homes. Due to the abortion laws (tightening state by state whenever possible), both adoption agencies and most especially the highly stressed Foster Care system are getting the children born to those that cannot (and do not, for their own personal reasons), keep their child. Fact, if Medicaid takes any kind of hit at all, so will the Foster Care system which now is inundated with babies due to Abortion Laws. Before this is viewed incorrectly…it doesn’t matter if I personally am Pro Choice or Pro Life, what does matter that the choice was made for women, and now we are dangerously close to taking away a lifeline for an overwhelmed system that is now beyond overwhelmed. If there is any doubt here; I will 100% take you to all of our family’s contacts from this world and introduce you to an amazing Family Court Judge (who we actively backed for reelection, a Republican who is a true advocate for children) to show factual implications of real life decisions due to person biases. 💔💔💔",Neutral,5,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1

Greg Abbott isn’t quite certain the state’s abortion laws need to be reworked despite stories of women having to leave the state when they have had complications during their pregnancies. While some Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have said they are open to potentially clarifying the law, Abbott said he’s convinced the law he signed in 2021 is already pretty clear that in cases where a woman’s life is in danger, doctors can perform an abortion. “There have been hundreds of abortions that have been provided under this law, so there are plenty of doctors and plenty of mothers that have been able to get an abortion that saved their lives and protect their health and safety,” Abbott told me in a recent interview. “So I know as the law as it currently exists can work if it is properly applied.” Abbott said when he signed the abortion ban into law, the intention was that the life of the mother would protected.    “To be honest, looking at the law and looking at the situation that some of these mothers have been in, some mothers have either been denied what they were rightfully entitled to or didn’t accept what they were rightfully entitled to,” he said. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. The Texas law doesn’t include exceptions for fetal abnormality, rape, or incest. Reporting by national investigative nonprofit ProPublica has shown that at least three women have died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages. Last year the Texas Supreme Court rejected a suit by 20 women calling for the state to clarify for doctors when they can perform abortions. That state’s abortion law became a key focal point of the 2024 elections....",Neutral,21,3,2,14,1,1,0,0,34,4

Research indicates that up to 90% of candidates perceive bias in hiring decisions, with 95% of recruiters acknowledging the role of unconscious bias.  Many organizations are actively seeking strategies to mitigate these biases and create a more inclusive and equitable recruitment process. AI offers a practical and data-driven approach to achieving these goals. Here are several ways AI can be leveraged to reduce bias in hiring: ✅Blind Resume Screening: By masking names, gender, and other potentially biasing information, recruiters can focus solely on a candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications, promoting merit-based evaluation. This ensures that decisions are based on competence rather than demographic factors. ✅Automated Resume Screening: Traditional keyword-based resume screening can be overly rigid and miss qualified candidates who might use different terminology to describe their skills. AI-driven semantic analysis understands the meaning behind the words, allowing for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of candidate suitability. This expands the talent pool and identifies hidden gems. ✅Diversity Analytics: AI provides valuable insights into an organization's hiring data, identifying potential gaps and imbalances in hiring practices. By tracking metrics such as candidate demographics at each stage of the hiring process, organizations can identify areas for improvement and implement targeted interventions to promote diversity and inclusion. What are your experiences with AI in reducing bias in hiring? Have you implemented any of these strategies in your organization? #staff #itstaff #itstaffingsolutions #staffaugmentation #itstaffaugmentation #itstaffingservices #itstaffingcompany #workethics #programming #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #Technology #Innovation #FutureofTech #AITools #DigitalTransformation",In-favor,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Freeman,2/18/25,"The problem isn’t the AI itself. It’s who designs it, who trains it, and who decides what good looks like. AI in HR isn’t just scanning resumes anymore. It’s making hiring decisions, evaluating performance, and even shaping workplace culture. AI is only as unbiased as the data it’s fed. And that data is shaped by human behavior. It’s shaped by our implicit biases, flawed reward systems, and deeply ingrained patterns. Here’s where behavior science can provide a perspective. Behavioral contingencies shape AI outcomes. If the data rewards conformity over diversity, efficiency over ethical decision-making, or output over well-being, AI will reinforce those. Feedback loops dictate organizational culture. AI-driven performance systems can either motivate or demoralize, depending on how behavior is reinforced. Accountability isn’t optional. Who’s analyzing the reinforcers behind AI decision-making? Who’s measuring its unintended consequences? AI doesn’t create bias; it automates it. If we don’t develop systems for designing and training, we’re just scaling our worst habits.

With AI leveling the playing field, companies can hire skilled talent in lower-cost regions at a fraction of the price. If you’re not leveraging AI, someone else is—and that could be the deciding factor in hiring decisions.

I know, I know—AI-powered hiring tools are everywhere. Resumes get scanned. Cover letters get keyword-matched. It feels like a robot is deciding your fate. But let’s be real: the real challenge? Humans. AI doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s built by people, trained on human-made data, and—surprise!—it picks up all the same biases we have. That means: ❌ Hiring AI might favor certain language styles (aka, privilege-coded resumes). ❌ It could replicate biases in past hiring decisions. ❌ It won’t actually assess your creativity or potential—just how well you ""match"" past candidates. So, instead of fearing AI, focus on navigating the humans behind it. ✅ Build relationships. Networking still gets you past the AI wall. ✅ Tailor your resume to be ATS-friendly and human-compelling. ✅ Remember: the final decision-maker is almost always a person. AI is a tool. Humans built it, humans control it, and humans still make the calls. So let’s stop pretending we’re fighting a sci-fi villain and get back to cracking the (very human) hiring code. #JobSearch #Hiring #AI #CareerTips",Off-topic,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Facebook,AI in Hiring Decisions,Recommended,,,HeyMilo AI,2/20/25,"Which candidate screening method is right for your business – traditional systems or AI-powered solutions? With hiring becoming more complex, this question has never been more relevant.  Traditional screening methods have stood the test of time, but the rise of AI offers new ways to tackle challenges like higher application volumes and identifying hidden talent. Here’s a quick glance at what AI screening can do for you: ✔️ Spot talent you might miss: AI identifies strong candidates with advanced pattern recognition and learns from past hiring data to sharpen decisions. ✔️ Save time and boost productivity: Automated processes handle large application volumes, reducing time-to-hire while giving detailed insights for smarter decisions. ✔️ Enhance the candidate experience: Faster processing and objective initial evaluations create a fairer, smoother experience for applicants. ✔️ Make data-driven hiring decisions: Real-time analytics predict who’s most likely to succeed, deliver clear reporting, and optimize future hires. Traditional methods, on the other hand, remain a solid option for organizations with smaller hiring volumes or more straightforward screening needs.  The key to success often lies not in choosing one over the other, but in understanding YOUR unique recruitment needs and creating a balanced approach. 💡 Still curious about how to decide between the two?

AI is revolutionizing# recruitment at a pace we haven’t seen since the internet first changed the way we do business. From automating admin tasks like scheduling #interviews to completely redefining how companies #hire, AI is no longer just an efficiency tool—it’s transforming the entire process. Take McDonald’s, for example. By implementing AI-driven hiring with #McHire, they cut their time-to-hire from 21 days to just 3, unlocking billions in revenue. Meanwhile, high-skill #hiring still requires a personal touch, but AI is streamlining background tasks to enhance candidate experience rather than replace it. The lesson?
