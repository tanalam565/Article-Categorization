Youtube,Climate Change,Recommended,Colorado River in Crisis: A Los Angeles Times documentary,United States,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8DovzEMxpY,,Video,Los Angeles Times,11/15/23,"Journalists from the Los Angeles Times travel along the Colorado River to examine how the Southwest is grappling with the water crisis.The Colorado River can no longer withstand the thirst of the arid West. Water drawn from the river flows to millions of people in cities from Denver to Los Angeles and irrigates vast farmlands. For decades, sections of the river have been entirely used up, leaving dusty expanses of desert where water once flowed to the sea in Mexico. Now, chronic overuse and the effects of climate change are pushing the river system toward potential collapse, with depleted reservoirs near the lowest levels since they were filled. A water reckoning is about to transform the landscape of the Southwest. Colorado River in Crisis follows Los Angeles Times journalists traveling throughout the river’s watershed, from the headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to the river’s dry delta. These stories reveal the stark toll of the river’s decline, responses that have yet to match the scale of the crisis, and voices that are urging a fundamental rethinking of how water is managed and used to adapt to the reality of an overtapped and dwindling river. This documentary was filmed and produced by Albert Brave Tiger Lee, with reporting by Ian James and other L.A. Times journalists.

Is global warming real? Are humans causing climate change? What is climate change? We do a deep dive into the data to find answers. The world today is 0.85 degrees (C) hotter than in 1980, projected to increase 1.5C in 40 years. A one degree increase means earth retains more energy than all the energy contained in the world’s known oil reserves. This retained energy has to go somewhere. And this is what causes havoc. More water evaporates from the oceans, causing more rainfall, increased energy in hurricanes. Sea levels rise because warmer water expands in volume, and more polar ice melts.  What is climate? The difference between climate vs weather is in the duration of changes. Climate is measured over decades, more than 30 years, weather in days, years.A higher temperature results in more extreme weather. It imparts more energy to affect more damage. Almost all energy on earth comes from the sun. The air is drier over land & heats up faster than over sea, because the specific heat capacity of water is higher than that of land, so it remains cooler than land.  As the air from the land goes up to form clouds, colder air from the sea comes to fill the gap. This causes winds. If the sun heats up earth more, it causes a bigger pressure difference between sea and land, causing more severe winds, and more extreme weather.Global warming accelerates evaporation of oceans, causing more rain, snow hail & droughts. It's not just about more heat.  Are higher temps be due to a hotter sun?  No because its irradiance varies by only about 0.15% over 11 years, not enough to explain the increase in global temps. Has the earth ever been this hot? Yes, it’s been hotter. 56 million years ago, earth warmed by 5-8C. This was the Paleo-Eocene thermal maximum (or PETM). Much of the land mass went underwater or was uninhabitable by animals. Scientists believe PETM is the most analogous event to what we are experiencing now. PETM was also initiated by increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it was from volcanoes.   Why does CO2 cause warming? Greenhouse gases have at least three atoms in their molecules. They are loosely held so can absorb more vibrational energy. They're efficient absorbers of long wave range light (heat) which bounces up from the earth’s surface. They re-emit this radiation back to Earth, resulting in warming. Non-greenhouse gases don’t absorb heat, allowing it to pass into space. On average net 0.24 gigatons of carbon was emitted into the atmosphere during a 50,000 year period during PETM. But humans are emitting fifty times more today. The current 1 degree warming occurred in less than 100 years, not 1000s of years as in PETM.  Is human carbon emission a cause of global warming?  Study of isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere shows higher C12 to C13 raios. Fossil fuels contain higher C12 so this is evidence. Volcanic eruptions increase C13, not C12. Volcanoes emit 1% as much CO2 as we do. The sun is not cause because it would heat both the upper AND lower atmosphere. But we see only warming of the lower atmosphere.  #climatechange When simulations are run using just natural causes of climate change, they predict no change in temperature. When unnatural emissions are added, it matches the data perfectly.",In-favor,119204,5100,992,1040000

So, what do we do about it? In this episode, Maiya May tries to figure this out. To start, she visits Tulare Lake, California, once a critical water reserve and cultural site for the Tachi-Yokut tribe, which has re-emerged after 150 years. Maiya learns about agriculture's challenges, the depletion of groundwater, and finds hope in innovative farming practices that reduce emissions and conserve water. She then heads back to California to learn how water officials are utilizing floods to recharge critical aquifers.

Youtube,Gun Control,Recommended,Why US gun laws get looser after mass shootings,United States,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB3qNWRaxGE,,Video,Vox,7/28/22,"Congress has rarely acted. But gun laws have been changing. Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo. gl/0bsAjO  For decades, the US Congress failed to make meaningful movement on gun reform in the aftermath of mass shootings. But that weak federal response has obscured another story: that state gun laws change after mass shootings all the time. And a study found that, in Republican-controlled state legislatures, a mass shooting roughly doubles the number of laws loosening gun restrictions in the next year. In this video we look at Texas, where decades of mass shootings in the US have been met with laws that expand gun access. We spoke with Flo Rice, a survivor of the 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting, where a gunman killed 10 people. Flo was shot six times. She and her husband, Scot, became advocates for gun safety, and tried to get tighter gun laws passed in Texas. Watch the piece above to see what happened, and what their story reveals about who has power when it comes to gun policy in the US. SOURCES: Here’s the 2020 study on gun laws we reference in the video: https://www. sciencedirect. com/science. . . The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has lots of resources to understand gun laws in the US. We mention that the US has only had a few major federal laws enacted on guns.

Youtube,Gun Control,Recommended,Do Studies Show Gun Control Works?,United States,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgiQ-LmJGMY,,Video,ReasonTV,5/31/22,"Out of 27,900 research publications on gun laws, only 123 tested their effects rigorously. ------------------ Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www. youtube. com/ReasonTV? sub_. . . Like us on Facebook:   / reason. magazine   Follow us on Twitter:   / reason   Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason. com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines. ---------------- After reaching historic lows in the mid-2010s, gun violence rates in America have gone up in recent years, and they remain higher than in some other parts of the developed world. There are hundreds of laws and regulations at the federal and state level that restrict Americans' access to guns, yet according to some advocates, social science research shows that a few more ""simple, commonsense"" laws could significantly reduce the number of injuries and deaths attributed to firearms. There has been a massive research effort going back decades to determine whether gun control measures work. A 2020 analysis by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization, parsed the results of 27,900 research publications on the effectiveness of gun control laws. From this vast body of work, the RAND authors found only 123 studies, or 0. 4 percent, that tested the effects rigorously. Some of the other 27,777 studies may have been useful for non-empirical discussions, but many others were deeply flawed. We took a look at the significance of the 123 rigorous empirical studies and what they actually say about the efficacy of gun control laws. The answer: nothing. The 123 studies that met RAND's criteria may have been the best of the 27,900 that were analyzed, but they still had serious statistical defects, such as a lack of controls, too many parameters or hypotheses for the data, undisclosed data, erroneous data, misspecified models, and other problems. And these glaring methodological flaws are not specific to gun control research; they are typical of how the academic publishing industry responds to demands from political partisans for scientific evidence that does not exist. Not only is the social science literature on gun control broadly useless, but it provides endless fodder for advocates who say that ""studies prove"" that a particular favored policy would have beneficial outcomes. This matters because gun laws, even if they don't accomplish their goals, have large costs. They can turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals, they increase prosecutorial power and incarceration, and they exacerbate the racial and socioeconomic inequities in the criminal justice system.

Instead of outright banning AR-15s and other rifles, they tried to bureaucratize the Second Amendment into oblivion—forcing gun owners through an absurd gauntlet of restrictions, fees, and a registry. 🔹 New ""eligibility card"" requirement—fingerprints, background checks, and no time limit for approval 🔹 4 to 12-hour training course (with “victim awareness” lessons… because that’ll stop criminals) 🔹 90% pass test on firearm laws (because now our rights come with a pop quiz) 🔹 State-run gun registry—because nothing ever goes wrong with those, right? And let’s not forget—Colorado already has magazine bans, red flag laws, universal background checks… yet crime hasn’t gone anywhere. Instead of admitting their policies don’t work, they’re doubling down. But here’s where it gets interesting—even some Democrats backed out of this bill because they knew it was political suicide.

There’s fever and pain, and it doesn’t go away. A trip to the doctor’s office lands you in the emergency room. Surgery follows, then several nights in the hospital. Weeks later, after more doctor’s appointments and loads of prescription medicine, you’re all well again, fit as a fiddle. And then they let you go on your merry way, without paying a penny. That’s right: $0. If you’re living in the United States, that is probably the stuff of fantasies. But not for our cousins in Britain, thanks to one of that country’s most noble creations: the National Health Service. It was founded in 1948 to provide free health care to all residents and has proudly stood as a much-loved symbol of British identity and the welfare state. But for several years the N.H.S., which celebrated its 75th birthday last summer, has been suffering its own serious health crisis. Last winter was the worst period ever for the system. People died in their homes waiting for ambulances to arrive, and hospitals overflowed with patients, with some assigned beds jammed into corridors. Millions of Britons have waited months for surgeries, and some, unable to find an N.H.S. dentist, have resorted to pulling out their own teeth. After a decade of stagnant salaries, nurses and doctors have staged walkouts, adding to the crisis. Now, as a new winter approaches, N.H.S. staff members fear that things will get even worse.The crisis has led to calls for Britain to scrap universal health care and return to a private or hybrid health system, like in the United States and other European countries. But as the Opinion video above argues, the N.H.S.’s woes are not a function of how it’s funded but the result of something else entirely.",In-favor,320630,11000,445,4660000
Youtube,Universal Healthcare,Recommended,Would Universal Healthcare Really Work in the U.S.?,United States,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmmirkyZBxY&t=16s, #healthcare #universalhealthcare,Video,Above The Noise,1/22/20,"Pretty much every rich, developed nation on the planet has universal healthcare, EXCEPT for the U. S. Should we join them, or does our current healthcare system have advantages that we don’t want to lose? SUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! https://bit. ly/3tNKzhV  And follow us on Instagram and Twitter! / abovethenoisepbs    / atn_pbs   **How does healthcare work in the U. S. ? In the U. S. , how you want to pay for healthcare is entirely up to you, as long as you have the money. Most people choose to buy health insurance. If you’re low income or over 65, you can get it from the government, but pretty much everyone else has to buy it from companies. You pay a set amount of money every month, and in return, the insurance company pays for most of your medical bills if you get sick or hurt. You can also choose to NOT buy insurance.  If you’re young and healthy and never have to go to a doctor or a hospital, you’re gonna save money. But you’re at risk for paying a LOT of money if you DO have a medical emergency, like a car wreck or falling off your bike and breaking your arm. So, it’s a gamble. *So how does universal healthcare work? * There are a BUNCH of different ways to get universal healthcare, and every country does it a little bit differently. There’s SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, where the government owns the hospitals, and the doctors and nurses are government employees. There is SINGLE-PAYER, where doctors and hospitals are private businesses, but there is almost no private insurance. Instead, the government provides health insurance for everyone. It can also work with PRIVATE INSURANCE, where people buy it from companies, but it’s HEAVILY regulated by the government, which REQUIRES everyone to have health insurance. *What are the pros with universal healthcare? * With universal healthcare, everyone is covered, your insurance isn’t tied to your job, and it would cost less *What are the cons? * Taxes would likely go up to pay for it, the quality of care might change, and the individual would have less choice.

These institutional foods are very low-quality, highly processed foods. The health of the people in these institutions would quickly improve by simply removing the refined sugars, starches, and oils from their diets. 2. Address the subsidized foods  Subsidized foods are paid for by taxpayers. Corn, soy, wheat, sugar, and rice are the most highly subsidized foods. Changing the types of foods that are subsidized and investing in small farmers can significantly improve this problem. 3. Changing GRAS  “Generally recognized as safe” is a term used by the FDA for products that have been safety tested by their own manufacturers. To avoid conflict of interest, these tests should be conducted by third-party independent companies. 4. Change food fortification Synthetic folic acid and iron fortification of food can cause serious problems for many people. 5. Disallow tax dollars from being used for drugs  Every year, 40 billion dollars of taxpayer money is used to pay for medical research to develop new drugs. 6. The rounding rule If a product contains less than . 5 grams of an ingredient, it can be rounded down to 0. This is misleading and should be eliminated. People need to be more aware of what's really in their food. Companies also need to be forced to raise the quality of the ingredients in their products. 7. End sun phobia Sun phobia paired with low RDAs for vitamin D is contributing to massive vitamin D deficiency in the population, putting people at risk for disease.

Anti-abortion activists say these centers will help women facing unplanned pregnancies in places where abortion is now illegal. But some women who have visited a CPC thinking it was an abortion clinic say they feel misled by the center's online advertising. We spoke to abortion providers and experts, met with someone who went to a CPC, and visited one ourselves, to figure out the impact of crisis pregnancy centers at a time when access to abortion is being rolled back across the country.

It has taken the world by storm. Characterized by its potential to generate human-like content based on deep learning models, this high-end technology can revolutionize education like never before. Hot new tools like ChatGPT sound obvious when we say they are built for writers, coders, and designers. But teaching is one phenomenon that is expected to be human-led. However, this shouldn’t hinder you from leveraging the potential of Generative AI to enhance teaching practices. According to the April 2023 EDUCAUSE QuickPoll results, 83% of higher education stakeholders agreed that Generative AI will profoundly change higher education in the next 3-5 years. According to a survey by the Walton Family Foundation, 51% of teachers use ChatGPT for school. Furthermore, 64% of teachers plan to implement ChatGPT more often – for lesson planning, creating new ideas, or using it as part of curriculum. The applications of Generative AI in the world of education are endless. Generative AI in teaching can work in various ways to improve instructional as well as learning outcomes and save the valuable time of faculties. Generative AI can automate and accelerate administrative tasks, grading, feedback, and student performance analysis. This helps faculties optimize teaching methods while allowing them more time for student interaction and strategic tasks. The right use of Generative AI enables educators to develop interactive learning experiences to create better teaching outcomes and support student growth. Generative AI in education solutions work around elements such as knowledge discovery, learning reinforcement, assessments, virtual teaching assistants, personalized learning, and content curation that play a catalyst in transforming pedagogies as well as learning in higher education. Believe it or not, Generative AI is making its way into the classroom and has a lot of hidden potential, which, when used mindfully, can redefine the way we teach. To explore more, join our upcoming Power Hour, “How Generative AI is Transforming Teaching in Higher Education,” on September 13, 2023, at 11 am ET. Hosted by Rahul Singh, Senior Director, EdTech, Harbinger Group, this interactive roundtable discussion will witness expert panelists joining from the education domain.
