Greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG levels). 2. Global annual air temperatures.  3. Global annual sea levels.  4. Arctic Glaciers melting rates.  5. The number and severity of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other extreme natural disasters.  6. Diameter of the Ozone hole over the Antarctic.  ➡️➡️➡️ Climate change effects are: Rising global temperatures, rising ocean temperatures, melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, biodiversity loss, habitat loss, deforestation, forest fires, floods, and droughts. 🌦️🔁⛔️ Efforts to combat climate change, called Climate Mitigation and Climate Adaptation, have focused on reducing carbon emissions, as carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.  ♻️🚘🌲 Climate change mitigation strategies include renewable energy, electric vehicles, reforestation, pollution reduction, clean sustainable fuels, carbon capture technologies, a circular economy of products, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing consumption and waste generation. 🇺🇳🇺🇳🇺🇳  Policy-wise, in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was established to combat climate change by limiting global temperature increases and supporting the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP). 🎯🎯🎯 Climate change mitigation directly supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 13): Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. ⚕️😷☠️ Climate change effects include extreme temperatures, causes poverty, reduced food, clean water, lower incomes, and worsening health, especially in children with developing immune systems more sensitive to disease and pollution.  📢📢📢Let's all take climate action for the future generation #Posterity #ClimateAction🧒👧👦 🌐🌐🌐 LEARN MORE: http://S2adesign.com #ClimateChange #AirPollution #RenewableEnergy #Environment #Deforestation #SDGs #Sustainability #Recycling #Circular #CapacityBuilding #Packaging #Innovation #Green #EcoFriendly #Solar #NetZero #Renewable #SolarEnergy #CleanEnergy #Energy #EnergyTransition #UNFCCC #ParisAgreement #Decarbonization #AI #Digital #SmartCity #ICT #Sustainable #EcoFriendly #Automation #Mitigation #SustainableCity #Environment #ClimateActionNow #Recycling #Waste #Climate #Decarbonization #SDG #Pollution #Technology #NetZero #PlasticWaste #ZeroWaste #SustainableCity #EnergyEfficiency #SustainableLiving  @saigetsumiki315 @ecogreen_action @AkihiroQuitada@maximletters @Get14et @quitada @arigatou163 @60128abstract @ASBELKEMBOI7@timh_en @JCPZMendrew @Plasticsimpact2@nandiyouthstv @jil_obi@boreal_co @Awesome48847891@sustainme_in @k254NairobiNews @ali_bakdur @AME_Ideology@HFarzambeh40232 @Parfait_Mush @nationwidetour1 @jackiedeburca @Zeden9_xpl @PNzivugira @Jenny25056491 @saradas2012 @ssef_uganda11 @worldgreendlp @mike_otuoma @Parfait_Mush @JKaufmann54452 @eddesign_ @jeanneyacoubou @BSuhic @fidele_kitsa @EarthAccounting @Rediscova1 @Erabanabar13421 @Emusugutpato @maurogab1 @Satydev_S_Negi @2white_jets @Saadjutt420 @ken13kenchan @irfanbenli4 @Rockjam136 @Fr_VanNyverseel @AnneMar27255501",In-favor,1359,86,3,25

They don’t even know what the hell is in the bill they just voted on. @GovofCOplease get your party under control and tell the House to scrap SB-003. If you sign it, kiss all 7 battleground states goodbye in 2028.  Here’s a summary to date:  SB-003 started off as a full-fledged gun ban, then suddenly became some bizarre may-issue gun owner ID licensing scheme laying the framework to turn Colorado into a de facto ‘no-issue’ permit to purchase state (i.e. gun ban). Gun shops don’t know what this bill asks them to do. Law abiding gun buyers are now being told they’ll need not one gun permit but 3 or 4 (permit to take a class to get a permit to purchase, on top of permit to carry and hunting permits ??? ). This means fees up the wazoo, more work for sheriffs being forced to spend time on implementing this instead of going after bad guys. It's a recipe for disaster which will result in reckless prosecution of law-abiding citizens, while giving a gift to thugs and gangbangers who run metro Denver.

He was in town to attend the company's annual shareholders' conference. United Health Care is the largest private health insurance provider in the United States. The company is a subsidiary of United Health Group — the 9th largest company in the world by revenue and the largest in the healthcare industry. The company's revenue reached nearly $300 billion in 2021. UHC manages a huge network of private medical centers and provides a variety of services to the United States government, meeting a substantial portion of the demand generated by health insurance subsidized by programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The company has been the target of several corruption allegations in recent decades. It has been accused of overcharging in the management of Medicare insurance and of manipulating the prices of health services.UHC has also been heavily criticized in the United States for prioritizing profits over the quality of its customers’ well-being. The company is known for denying or restricting coverage for more expensive medical procedures, leaving patients who suffer from chronic illnesses or need to undergo expensive and complex procedures without care.This could be the motive for the murder of the company's CEO. Police said that bullet casings recovered at the crime scene were inscribed with the words ""deny,"" ""defend"" and ""depose.""It is possible that this is a reference to the book ""Delay, Deny, Defend"" by legal scholar Jay Feinman.

But within weeks, she discovered a harsh reality – the product wasn't working, and the business needed a complete reset.She made the difficult decision to fire the entire team, including the founder. With just six weeks of runway left, she had to quickly raise funding to keep the business alive. The next two years were a constant struggle for survival. Some months, Barb wasn't sure if they'd make payroll. She and her small team worked to rebuild the product from scratch, conducting countless experiments to find the right approach. Landing their first major customer, Qantas Airlines, took a series of 15 trial runs over several years before they finally signed an enterprise deal. And just as they were gaining momentum, COVID hit, making it even harder for them to close new business. But Barb and her team focused on building a product customers would love. Their persistence started paying off as more companies began seeing value in their approach. They won contracts with some of Australia's largest brands, with much of their growth coming through customer referrals.Today, Sapia is approaching eight-figures in ARR with a team of 45 people and has raised over $21 million in funding. In this episode, you'll learn: - How Barb navigated the difficult transition from fixing to completely resetting a struggling startup - Why focusing on product excellence over sales and marketing was a strategic gamble that paid off - What led to their failed US expansion and how they found success in the UK market instead - How personal touches, like handwritten Christmas cards to clients, became their secret growth weapon - Why Barb believes that having clear AI regulations actually creates more opportunities than constraints in enterprise sales I hope you enjoy it!
